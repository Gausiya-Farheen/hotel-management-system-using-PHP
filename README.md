# hotel-management-system-using-PHP
This is a hotel management project which is completed by using PHP,Mysql,Bootstrap,Html,Css,Javascript. I have tried to make a website which is more user friendly and therefore does not necesserily require users to sign-up or sign-in to book a room. It completely depends on the user as rooms can be booked without it . This project does the basic work of a booking system, that is it shows all the rooms available at the required range of dates and gives option of booking and payment only if booking is done beforehand and also generates invoice and payment option through card or cash on arrival to hotel.
